file: '.playbook/kit/05-kanban.md'
responsibility: 'Work state registry for active tickets and blocking relationships.'
ai_instructions: 'Update statuses as tasks progress. Seed tickets from 03-execution.md.'
archive_rule: 'Done tickets no longer referenced move to .playbook/kit/_archives/kanban/'

Rules

- Tickets are seeded from Acceptance Criteria in `03-execution.md`
- One outcome per ticket — no bundling
- Priority within each column is top-down (top = next)
- Blocked tickets stay in their column; blocking relationship is explicit
- When a ticket moves to Done, update `04-progress.md`

DDA Ticket Types

- [DDA] — authoring or syncing a DDA document
- [CODE] — implementation against a DDA doc (requires DDA doc to be status: active)
- [SYNC] — drift correction between code and DDA doc

In Progress
[K-12] Populate playbook/ template structure
[K-18] Confirm template README/AI-INSTRUCTIONS reference standalone path

Blocked
(none)

Done
[K-01] Resolve 00-rules.md vs AI-INSTRUCTIONS.md
(Resolved: 00-rules.md deprecated; AI-INSTRUCTIONS.md is the single source of truth)

[K-03] Standardize YAML Frontmatter adoption
(Resolved: Light YAML frontmatter successfully adopted across framework files)

[K-11] Migrate internal Context Kit to .playbook/kit/
(Resolved: All tracking files shifted to root .playbook/kit/)

[K-02] De-duplicate template sources
(Resolved by meta-repo architecture: internal templates live in .playbook/, distributable ones in playbook/)

[K-08] Scope @bogsp/playbook-software-library into the plan
(Resolved by meta-repo architecture: explicitly mapped to packages/)

[K-09] Scope the C11 engine / Rust shell subproject
(Resolved: Legacy C11/Rust subproject explicitly discarded from structure)

[K-14] Split Context Kit guide into standalone vs. integrated usage
(Resolved: Authored playbook/.playbook/guides/context-kit-standalone.md. Updated context-kit.md with a cross-link. Resolves Q-02.)

[K-15] Restructure guide entry points for standalone Context Kit path
(Resolved: Added "Which Guide Do I Need?" journey matrix to guides/\_index.md. Resolves K-06.)

[K-16] Fix terminology drift and standardize frontmatter across pipeline guides
(Resolved: Fixed broken reverse-engineer.md → audit.md links in adopt.md. Added missing project-identity.md cross-links. Converted five guides to standardized frontmatter. Follow-up fix: video-insights.md's embedded output template also converted.)

[K-17] Add standalone Context Kit session-start prompt
(Resolved: Added "Starting or Resuming — Context Kit Standalone" as the first prompt in kit/00-prompts.md, cross-linked to context-kit-standalone.md. Fixed a stray broken placeholder in the existing Video Insights prompt's Source: line, found while editing nearby.)

[K-27] Map template flows — playbook-templates
(Resolved, scope expanded twice beyond original ticket text: authored docs/flows/playbook-templates/ with seven flows — flow-1-edit-template-source and flow-2-build-and-publish for internal build mechanics, plus flow-3-new-project, flow-4-adopt-existing-project, flow-5-audit-existing-project, flow-6-resume-session, flow-7-milestone-handoff-and-resume for pipeline user journeys. _index.md rewritten with a Groups split and full dependency map. Also standardized frontmatter on playbook/docs/flows/flow.md, playbook/docs/contracts/contract.md, and playbook/docs/contracts/global.md as part of the same pass, fixing a hardcoded Type: software bug in those templates. See 02-exploration.md 2026-08-11 decisions and Q-04. Amended again to add the pipeline-stage-numbered flow-6-work-stage.md and flow-7-handoff-and-resume.md needed to companion K-28's contracts — the pipeline-stage flow set (flow-0 through flow-7, matching Audit/Thinking/Discovery/Mapping/Rules/Planning/Work/Handoff) is distinct from the mechanics/journey flow set named above and both currently coexist under docs/flows/playbook-templates/; K-32 should confirm _index.md reflects both sets correctly rather than treating this as a naming conflict to resolve silently.)

[K-28] Write docs/contracts/playbook-templates/
(Resolved: Authored docs/contracts/playbook-templates/flow-1 through flow-7, plus updated docs/contracts/global.md (the playbook-templates track's global contract, retained at root docs/contracts/global.md per the Q-04 decision) with two new sections — §9 Plan-Before-Divergence, §10 No Invented Content. All 8 contracts complete: global.md, flow-0 (already existed from an earlier session), flow-1 through flow-7. Byproduct: authored the two flow documents that were missing despite being listed in global.md's governs field — flow-6-work-stage.md and flow-7-handoff-and-resume.md — logged as an amendment to K-27 above.)
